        <p>
          “During my time at The UNcovered Experience, I grew closer to both{" "}
          <br /> God and my wife because of the experience. I also learnt how{" "}
          <br /> to continue to work on our marriage using the tools I acquired{" "}
          <br /> throughout my training. This gives me a little hope. Despite my
          lack <br /> of experience, I am confident in my ability to achieve.”
        </p>
        <p>
          We want you to have the same experience as we had. Already, a <br />{" "}
          group of individuals is praying for you and your husband/wife.
